I have developed the BirthdayReminder app, a sample application designed to help users remember important birthdays. While the user interface (UI) can be enhanced further, the core functionalities are fully operational.

The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and making the code more maintainable and testable. Leveraging Android WorkManager, the app schedules timely notifications, allowing users to receive reminders ahead of birthdays.

Key features include:

Efficient Notification System: Users can schedule notifications at specific times, enhancing their ability to remember significant dates.
MVVM Architecture: This design pattern facilitates better organization of code and makes it easier to manage the app's state.

Overall, the BirthdayReminder app serves as a functional prototype that demonstrates the capabilities of modern Android development practices.

This app is available for all Android developers who wish to utilize or contribute to its functionalities. I encourage anyone interested to explore the code and integrate it into their projects.
